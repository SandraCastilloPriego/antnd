        <h1>K-Neighborhood Filter module</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>                
        <p>
            A filter used to extract the k-neighborhood around one root node(s). The k-neighborhood is defined as the subgraph 
            induced by the set of vertices that are k or fewer hops (unweighted shortest-path distance) away from the root node.
