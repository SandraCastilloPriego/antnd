        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This module shows a list of all the reactions in the selected model. It starts the list with the number of reactions listed. Then 
            the list has two parts: one list with the ID and name of each reaction,the reactants and products, and the bounds, and another 
            list with only the ID and the name of the reaction without more information. 
        </p>        
        <p>
            This list can be copied and pasted into another program to be studied.
