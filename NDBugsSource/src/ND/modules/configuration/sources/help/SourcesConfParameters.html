        <h1>Sources and bounds configuration</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This module asks for two files: sources file which should be a .csv file (tab separated) containing 3 columns and no headers ("compound id", "lower bound", "upper bound")
            , and bound file which should be a .csv file (comma separated) with 5 columns and no headers ("reaction ID", "reaction name", "reaction info", "lower bound", "upper bound")
        </p>           
        <p>
            If the exchange reactions containing the sources are already inside the SBML file, the file with the sources could be empty.
        </p>
