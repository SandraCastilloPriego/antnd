\textbf{Summary:} Metabolic modeling is a widely used tool for the study of cell metabolism. Also, it is important in the development of microbial strains capable of high efficiency production of chemicals or proteins. High-quality metabolic models are needed for accurate metabolic simulations and predictions. The database BioModels \cite{juty_biomodels:_2015} hosts 2641 whole-genome stoichiometric models created using pathway information from KEGG or MetaCyc. The curation of these models to make them functional and able to predict experimental data is a tedious process \cite{thiele_protocol_2010}.  AntND is a software framework that enhances the manual curation, analysis, visualization and optimization of metabolic models. It contains modules for reading and writing files in SBML format, adding or removing reactions into the models, changing bounds of the reactions, extracting subnetworks, performing FBA optimizations, visualizing and analyzing the networks. 

\textbf{Avaliability and implementation:} AntND is implemented using java and is distributed freely under GNU General Public Licence. It's code is hosted in github.
