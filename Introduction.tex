\section{Introduction}
Many metabolic models are being created using automated pipelines such as RAVEN [cite] or CoReCo. This pipelines produce models very fast but still intensive manual curation is needed to make these models useful for simulation. For example, CoReCo is able to construct several metabolic models of related organisms at the same time but they lack compartmentalization and gene rules. BioModels hosts at this moment [check amount]. There are other software able to visualize:

FASIMU[cite] <- not GNU, only FBA, no visualization
SurreyFBA <- old?
Acorn
FAME
GEMSiRV
MetaFluxNet
FBA-SimVis
OptFlux
SEED
